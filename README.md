### Introduction
The project contains a basic framework to create different 3D twisty puzzles. It includes definitions for general sized permutation puzzles based on 3 of the platonic solids (Tetrahedron, Cube, & Octahedron).
The contained defnitions can be extended to create variants for other platonic solids or even completely new 3D permutation puzzles with crazy structures!

### Requirements
The project runs best on latest chrome with screen resolutions at least 1366x768 on a reasonably fast machine, but should also work fine on latest Firefox/Safari with screen resolution at least 1024x768.

### Todo
Implement puzzles for Dodecahedron & Icosahedron.
