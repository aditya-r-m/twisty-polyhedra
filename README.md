### Introduction

The project contains a basic framework to create different 3D twisty puzzles. It includes definitions for general sized permutation puzzles based on the platonic solids: Tetrahedral, Cubic & Dodecahedral puzzles as well as Face turning Octahedra & Axis turning Icosahedra.

The contained defnitions can be extended to model other known shapes or to create completely new permutation puzzles with crazy structures!

### Requirements

The interface relies on cursor gestures & works best with latest chrome on a desktop/laptop having screen resolutions at least 1366x768 on a reasonably fast machine, but it should also work fine on latest Firefox/Safari with screen resolution at least 1024x768.
